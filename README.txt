This is an android application that shows weather data for next few days. But the best part about this application is it gives you suggestion based on the climate of the day.

For example: 
- On a rainy day, it will give you suggestion to carry umbrella when you leave home.
- On a sunny day (let's say over 30 C, it will suggest you to carry sun cream

WeatherItemsService.java is the REST service that gives the required alert messages based on different inputs like temperature of the day, what type of climate it is (rainy, sunny etc).
